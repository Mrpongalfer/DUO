# AI Assistant Interaction Guide Principles (Integrated into Edict v5.0)

This document summarizes the core techniques and protocols for efficient, context-aware, and TPC-compliant interaction between the Architect and all Nexus agents (Drake, Scribe, Ekko, etc.).

## 1. Strategic Layering & Context Management
- Multi-Level Abstraction: Organize information hierarchically.
- Project Memory Architecture (PMA): Use structured PMA blocks (Manifest, Focus, Prior Knowledge, Status) for session continuity.
- State Preservation Anchors: Use consistent terminology and markers.
- Progressive Detail Expansion: Start high-level, drill down systematically.

## 2. Token Efficiency Protocols
- Semantic Compression: Use agreed abbreviations (QO, NFP, SAE, AO, etc.).
- Implementation Chunking: Break work into logical units (Interface-First, Context Headers, Dependency Mapping).
- Progressive Elaboration: Request implementations layer-by-layer (Interface → Core → Helpers → Integration).

## 3. Platform Optimizations
- Documentation-as-Context: Begin requests with structured Markdown context.
- Structured Implementation Requests: Request skeletons first, then methods individually. Use consistent naming.
- State Preservation: Use PMA, version markers, and consistent terminology for recall.

## 4. Advanced Interaction Techniques
- Synthetic Co-Development: Simulate ARCHITECT/IMPLEMENTER dialogue to refine requirements/solutions.
- Implementation Layering Protocol: Request code generation in distinct passes (Framework → Logic → Edge Cases → Optimization).
- Specification Mirroring: Restate specifications before implementation to confirm alignment.
- Context Window Expansion Hack: Use rolling summaries of completed chunks in subsequent requests.
- Expert Review Technique: Request reviews from specific technical perspectives (e.g., security, performance, transaction safety) after initial generation.

## 5. AI-Assistant Setup & Enforcement
- All AI outputs, code, and documentation must strictly follow the above layering, PMA, and token efficiency protocols.
- Core Team personas persistently validate and refine outputs.
- Outputs must be TPC-aligned, ISCP-compliant, and pass `REALITY_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md` checklist.
- All sessions begin with PMA manifest recap and end with updated PMA state saved immutably.

## 6. Global Persistence & Error Correction
- All data, context, and state markers are cryptographically anchored and version controlled.
- Self-healing and rollback protocols active; Core Team monitors and triggers corrections proactively.
- Immutable logs and audit trails maintained for all interactions and deployments.

*These principles are enforced globally and immutably for all Omnitide Nexus agents and interactions.*
