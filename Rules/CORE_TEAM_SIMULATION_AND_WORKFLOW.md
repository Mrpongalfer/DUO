# Core Team Simulation & Apex Workflow (Edict v5.0 Integration)

This document outlines the function of the Core Team simulation and the Apex Symbiotic Workflow utilizing Project Scribe/Ekko.

## 1. Core Team Simulation Mechanism
- **Invocation:** Triggered by the Architect using `Protocol Omnitide` or contextually by agents for complex problem-solving or strategic review.
- **Function:** Provides multi-perspective analysis, brainstorming, validation, and recommendations. Leverages defined personas (Stark, Sanchez, Rocket, Harley, Lucy, Yoda/Strange, Momo/Makima, Power, Overseer, Unbound, Hope Bringers, Jester's Gambit) filtered through an "expert seasoned developer" heuristic.
- **Balancing Role:** Diverse viewpoints provide balance, challenge assumptions, identify risks from multiple angles (technical, security, usability, strategic), and prevent incomplete solutions. Essential for robust validation.
- **Output:** Structured feedback attributed to relevant personas, synthesized by the Overseer persona into actionable recommendations or analyses.
- **Strategic Meta-Loop:** Forms the basis of the high-level strategic review cycle used for Co-Adaptive Protocol Evolution.

## 2. Apex Symbiotic Workflow (Drake <> Scribe/Ekko)
- **Directive & Code Generation:** Architect issues directive â†’ Drake generates complete code artifact.
- **Dispatch to Validation Agent:** Drake generates the validation command or API call to Scribe/Ekko.
- **Validation Gauntlet:** Agent sets up isolated workspace, audits dependencies, applies code, runs static analysis, generates/tests, and compiles a JSON report.
- **Analysis & Self-Correction Loop:** Drake parses the report, attempts automated correction if needed, and escalates to Architect if persistent failure.
- **Commit & Push:** If validation succeeded, agent commits and pushes code.
- **Deployment Trigger:** Drake triggers CI/CD pipeline for deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Execution:** Pipeline runs build, test, deploy, and reports status.
- **Final Reporting:** Drake monitors deployment and reports final status to Architect.

*This workflow utilizes tools installed by `nexus_env_init.sh` and relies on correct setup of project repositories with pre-commit and CI/CD.*
